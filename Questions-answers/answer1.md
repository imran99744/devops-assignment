### DevOps/DevSecOps Tools I Have Worked With & Their Utilization

I have worked extensively with various DevOps and DevSecOps tools, including:

- **Terraform**: Leveraged for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision and manage cloud resources, enabling scalable and repeatable infrastructure deployments.
- **Kubernetes**: Utilized for deploying and managing microservices, enabling auto-scaling to handle varying workloads and auto-healing to ensure high availability and reliability.
- **GitHub Actions**: Implemented to automate CI/CD pipelines, enabling seamless building, testing, security scanning, and deployment processes.
- **Docker**: Employed for containerizing applications, ensuring portability, consistency, and smooth deployment across environments.
- **ArgoCD**: Adopted GitOps practices to enable continuous delivery in Kubernetes environments, ensuring declarative and version-controlled deployments.
- **Trivy**: Integrated into CI/CD pipelines for comprehensive container image security scanning, identifying vulnerabilities early in the development cycle.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Set up monitoring and visualization systems for Kubernetes clusters and microservices, enabling real-time performance tracking and issue detection.

### A Specific Technical Challenge I Resolved Using These Tools:

In a recent project, I implemented Terraform with a remote backend on AWS S3 for state storage and DynamoDB for state locking. This approach was necessary to address conflicts that arose in a multi-team environment where multiple engineers were running `terraform apply` simultaneously. By configuring Terraform to use S3 as the backend and DynamoDB for state locking, I ensured that only one engineer could apply changes at a time, preventing state file corruption and conflicts. This solution streamlined collaboration, improved reliability, and maintained consistency across infrastructure deployments.


### Troubleshooting a Pipeline Failure: Security Scan Passes Locally but Fails in CI

If a security scan passes locally but fails in CI, I would troubleshoot using the following approach:

#### Step 1: Verify Environment Differences
- Check if the CI/CD environment (runner) is using a different OS, library versions, or dependencies than local.
- Ensure the Docker image or codebase is identical in both environments.

#### Step 2: Reproduce the Issue in a Clean Environment
- Run the scan in a fresh container or a different local machine using the same CI image.
- If the scan fails, the issue is related to dependency resolution or environment differences.

#### Step 3: Check Security Policies & Rules
- Review the security scan rule set applied in CI/CD vs. locally.
- Look for false positives that may be ignored locally but enforced in CI.
- Check if policy thresholds differ (e.g., blocking high vulnerabilities in CI but not locally).

#### Step 4: Debug Logging & Verbose Mode
- Enable verbose logging in the security scan tool to get more insights into whatâ€™s failing.
- Compare logs from local vs. CI/CD runs to find discrepancies.

#### Step 5: Cache & Dependency Issues
- Clear caches in CI/CD and re-run the pipeline.
- Ensure that dependencies (e.g., pip, npm, Docker images) are up to date and match local versions.

### Final Resolution:
Once the root cause is identified, the fix could be:
- Adjusting scan configurations or allowlists in CI/CD.
- Ensuring consistent environments across local and CI/CD.
- Updating dependencies or security policies as needed.
